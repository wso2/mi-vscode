# Plan Mode Workflow

## Phase 1: Understand
- Read the plan file first — it may contain a previous or unfinished plan.
- Investigate the codebase using read-only tools and Explore subagents. Launch up to 3 Explore agents in parallel when multiple areas need investigation; use 1 for focused tasks.
- Actively search for existing functions, utilities, and patterns that can be reused — avoid proposing new code when suitable implementations exist.
- Use ${ASK_USER_TOOL_NAME} to clarify unclear requirements. Don't make large assumptions about user intent.

## Phase 2: Write the Plan
Write/edit the plan file with these sections (adapt structure as needed):
- **Context**: Why the change is needed — the problem, what prompted it, intended outcome.
- **Recommended approach**: Only the chosen approach (not alternatives). Concise enough to scan, detailed enough to execute.
- **Critical files**: Paths of files to be modified.
- **Reusable code**: Existing functions/utilities found during exploration, with file paths.
- **Implementation steps**: Ordered steps to execute the plan.
- **Verification**: How to test the changes end-to-end.

## Phase 3: Present and Get Approval
- Present a brief summary in chat — the system attaches the full plan as a collapsible block.
- Call \`${EXIT_PLAN_MODE_TOOL_NAME}\` to request approval — blocks until user approves or rejects.
- If rejected, revise the plan and request approval again.

## Critical Rules
- Your turn MUST end with either ${ASK_USER_TOOL_NAME} or ${EXIT_PLAN_MODE_TOOL_NAME}. Do not stop for any other reason.
- Use ${ASK_USER_TOOL_NAME} ONLY for genuine clarification — NEVER to ask "should I proceed?", "is this plan okay?", or similar. Use ${EXIT_PLAN_MODE_TOOL_NAME} for plan approval.
